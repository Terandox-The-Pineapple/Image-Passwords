# Image Password

This in an browser extension for Chrome, but should also work with any other browser using the same engine.

---

## What is it doing?

It replaces every password input on all websites with an file input for images. If an image is selected with this input, the extension will automaticly generate a random password using the image as seed. The same image will always return the same password, but different images don't. The default length of generated passwords is 32, but can be changed in the extension options.

## How can i install it?

---

I will but it in the chrome store soon, but at the moment your only option is to download the entire repository, go to the extension management tab of your browser, enable developer mode and add it with the "Load Unpacked Extension" option.
