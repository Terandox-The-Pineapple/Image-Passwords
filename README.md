# Image Password

This in an browser extension for Chrome, but should also work with any other browser using the same engine.

## What is it doing?

It replaces every password input on all websites with an file input for images. If an image is selected with this input, the extension will automaticly generate a random password using the image as seed. The same image will always return the same password, but different images don't. The default length of generated passwords is 32, but can be changed in the extension options.

## How can i install it?

1. Download the .zip file the releases page
2. Unzip it to an empty folder
3. Open the extension management page of your chromium based browser
4. Enable developer mode
5. Add the folder via the "Load Unpacked Extension" option
6. enjoy
